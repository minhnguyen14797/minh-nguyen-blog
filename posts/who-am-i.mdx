<Introduction />

My name is **Minh Nguyen** and coding is my hobby. I love everything about software development, 
from reading up theories to solving developing problems. I have always wanted to build my own blog/wesbite 
so I dedicated a lot of time to build this website from scratch using mainly JavaScript and its frameworks.

    How It All Started
</Heading>

Since high school, I wanted to learn how to code and make programs that could help me 
solve my everyday problems. In fact, I remember **my first ever program** I wrote was on 
one of the **TI-84 calculator** where it uses simple coding language to create custome programs. 
I made a program to calculate the result of a certain equation given some input numbers to help me 
in my math class (I totally forgot what equation it was and honestly, I don't remember much of 
high school calculus).

<br/>

Not until college, my statistic class required me to **learn some basic R** to help with graphing and 
data analysis. Although it was very simple lines of code and most of the time, the TA just gave us 
the codes instead of us writing them ourselves, I would still consider **R is my first official programming** 
language (still, it is mostly for data analysis and not writing software or programs). Even then, I love 
writing codes and for me, computer language seems to make sense to me (except for very low level languages, 
I still don't understand much).

After graduating from college in 2020, while having a full-time job, I decided to take [Udemy online class on Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) 
instructed by [Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) and I definitely felt in love with solving coding problems and writing programs. 
Angela went from the basic of Python to advance Python and some of its applications, such as Data Science, Data Analysis, Website Development, etc. 
Now, I still use Python in Jupyter Notebook for data analysis at my work. 

<br/>

After Python, I took several different classes but not any new programming language until I took another [Udemy course on Web Development with JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). 
Since I already know the basic of programming, transitioning to JS was pretty smooth. I picked up the basic of JS fairly quickly. 
I learned that I enjoy writing JS a lot more since I personally think that for writing programs or websites, **JS offers a much better options and capabilities** 
for the developer while **Python is great for Data Science and Data Analysis**. Additionally, JS developer community is very strong so they always provide many open-source packages that help 
developer like me to create websites.

    Why Am I Not A Software Engineer?
</Heading>

Don't get me wrong, I would love to write code, design and engineer software systems for living. However, for now, I just don't think it is 
the right path for me to fully dedicate my life to. 

<br/>

I graduated UC Davis with a BS in [Food Science and Technology](https://foodscience.ucdavis.edu/). I love food and science so that was why I picked this major coming into college. 
I love the Food Science program here at UC Davis and since it is an agricutural school, the Food Science program receives **a lot of fundings and supports**. 
Food Science is a very diverse major because it required you to take many different science classes, and Food Science graduate don't just go to work 
at a food company, but many have transitioned into health, med school, software, etc.

    My Goal
</Heading>

Right now, my goal is to go to **graduate school for Food Science** because eventually, I would want to work for a **sustainable food tech company**. I am a big advocate for 
a greener world by producing and consuming less meat (mainly beef). Raising cows produces a lot of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere through cow's fart, which will cause 
irreversible climate change problems that the future generations would have to deal with. Furthermore, livestock takes up a lot of land which could be used for other more sustainable agricutural 
pratices. [GFI (Good Food Institute)](https://www.gfi.com/) provides a lot of information and resources that you can read if you would like to know more about this field. 

<br/>

Ultimately, since I want to work for this specific sustainable field in the future, I don't want to fully pursue software engineer as a career. Or at least not until the sustainability trend has changed or 
my dream just doesn't work out in the future. For now, I still always want to improve in web developing and software engineering through curiosity and the love of writing code.

Besides hustling everyday trying to learn new things while working full-time, I love soccer (or football!). I love watching **soccer and playing soccer**. 
My team is [Liverpool FC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/) playing in the English Premier League. If you would like to talk about soccer, you can also 
contact me. 

I also danced pretty competitively back in college. I joined a team called **Press PLAY in Sacramento, California**. I was on the team, performing, and competing 
around the Bay Area and San Diego for most of my 4 years in college except for my last year, which was the beginning of COVID pandemic (sadly). I don't dance 
much nowadays besides occasionally at the bars or clubs or parties.
