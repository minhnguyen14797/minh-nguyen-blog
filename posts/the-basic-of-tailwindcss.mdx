<Introduction />

Traditionally, whenever you want to create an aesthetically pleasing website,
you would need to write CSS in a separate file. With Tailwind CSS, you can apply
style elements by applying **pre-existing classes** directly in your HTML.
This approach removes the need to write a single line of CSS.

<br/>

Of course, you might think that "*Isn't this would just make your HTML, more
messy and even less readible?*". The answer is yes, but no.
Sure, styling your HTML with bunch of classes can make your code long and 
less readible. But, when you actually implement Tailwind CSS into your code, 
you will quickly notice some benefits:

<br/>

- **No more inventing class names**. You can stop coming up with silly class names, such as 
`navbar-inner-brand`. Since you can directly style with pre-defined classes in your HTML, there 
is no need for making class names.
- **No more giant CSS files with hundreds of lines**. With traditional CSS, your CSS file will get 
bigger as your project expands. Tailwind CSS eliminates the use of a single CSS file and instead, 
separate them into your HTML.
- **Local changes feels safer**. Making changes in your global CSS can affect other components in 
your project if you aren't careful due to confusing class names. Since classes are local to each HTML file 
you don't have to worry about messing up your `Content` while styling your `Navbar`.

You can apply primitive utilities to build complex components. Pre-existing classes mimic CSS styling without 
writing CSS code. 

<br/>

From this:

<CodeFrame titles="index.html, styles.css, combined.html">
```HTML
<div class="chat-notification">
  <div class="chat-notification-logo-wrapper">
    <img class="chat-notification-logo" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="ChitChat Logo">
  </div>
  <div class="chat-notification-content">
    <h4 class="chat-notification-title">ChitChat</h4>
    <p class="chat-notification-message">You have a new message!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

```CSS
.chat-notification {
  display: flex;
  max-width: 24rem;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  background-color: #fff;
  box-shadow: 0 20px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 10px 10px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);
}
.chat-notification-logo-wrapper {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
.chat-notification-logo {
  height: 3rem;
  width: 3rem;
}
.chat-notification-content {
  margin-left: 1.5rem;
  padding-top: 0.25rem;
}
.chat-notification-title {
  color: #1a202c;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  line-height: 1.25;
}
.chat-notification-message {
  color: #718096;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

</CodeFrame>

<br/>

to this:

<CodeFrame titles="index.html">
```html
<div class="p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg flex items-center space-x-4">
  <div class="shrink-0">
    <img class="h-12 w-12" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="ChitChat Logo">
  </div>
  <div>
    <div class="text-xl font-medium text-black">ChitChat</div>
    <p class="text-slate-500">You have a new message!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
</CodeFrame>

<br/>

With Tailwind CSS, it removes the need to write `styles.css`. Instead, it has provided you 
classes to style your HTML, such as `p-6` for `padding: 6px` and `bg-white` for `background-color: white`.

<br/>

This reduces the need for a separate CSS file so you can work locally in your HTML 
(which can be very helpful when you are also working with a [React Framework](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)).

<BlockQuote author="Tailwind CSS">
  Aside from that, maintaining a utility-first CSS project turns out to be a lot easier than maintaining a 
  large CSS codebase, simply because HTML is so much easier to maintain than CSS. Large companies like GitHub, 
  Netflix, Heroku, Kickstarter, Twitch, Segment, and more are using this approach with great success.

  Handling Hover, Focus, and Other States
</Heading>

Different modifiers of states can be added to the beginning of the utility classes for specific conditions. 
For example, if you want `bg-sky-400` when you hover over an element, you can use `hover:bg-sky-400`.


<DisplayCode modifiers='center'>
  <button className="text-dark py-1 px-5 font-bold rounded-md bg-sky-300 hover:bg-sky-400">Submit</button>
</DisplayCode>

Tailwind includes different modifiers for you, including: 

- **Pseudo-classes** (`:hover`, `:required`, `:first-child`, ...)
- **Pseudo-elements** (`::selection`, `::before`, ...)
- **Media queries** (responsive breakpoints, ...)
- **Attribute selectors**

<br/>

The modifiers can also be stacked with each other: 

<CodeFrame>
```HTML
<button class="md:hover:bg-sky-400">
  Submit
</button>
```
</CodeFrame>

This will result in a hover effect only at medium screen size.

Tailwind also provides you pre-defined breakpoints, which you can change if you would like to. 

- `sm`: 640px
- `md`: 768px
- `lg`: 1024px
- `xl`: 1280px
- `2xl`: 1536px

I think the **main reason that I like to work with Tailwind** is that it simplifies styling 
and file structuring for me. 

<br/>

- It helps me work a bit more efficiently with **inline HTML styling**. 
- I think the wording of pre-defined classes are **easy to learn and understand** when you read the code.
- It makes creating **responsive design** easy and more understandable without using media queries in CSS. 
- The **official documentation** is very **well written** and clearly illustrated for users.

<br/>

This is just a quick introduction on Tailwind CSS and I would highly recommend read [the official documentation on their website](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
to understand more about the framework and how you can implement it into your own projects.
