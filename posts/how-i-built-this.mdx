<Introduction />

I will explain in details to you how I built this website from scratch. 
As someone who self-taught how to code, I learned a lot about web design 
and JavaScript. This was a learning experience for me and I hope that 
this blog will encourage and help you to create your own blog from 
scratch (or if you just want to know my process). 

<br/>

<Heading 
    tag="h1"
    name="framework"
>Framework</Heading>

This blog uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) by [Vercel](https://twitter.com/vercel?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). 
In short, NextJS is a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
Framework that utilizes **both static & server rendering**, 
which is also the main reason why I chose this 
framwork. For personal blog, since most contents are static to 
the readers (It doesn't change constantly), it would be more 
optimized in **rendering speed and better user experience** if the 
pages are loaded quick without fetching data from the server.


<br/>

For example, this current "How I Built This Website" blog post 
is statically rendered, meaning it is rendered at build-time rather 
than at request time. This also means that when you click onto this 
post's directory, NextJS will redirect you to this pre-rendered page 
right away without requesting it from the server. `getStaticProps` and 
`getStaticPaths` were used to achieve this. 

<br/>

Here are the links to the 
documents by Vercel if you would like more information on these functions:

- [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-props)
- [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths)

<br/>

Furthermore, I like using NextJS or ReactJS because they support 
many different packages, which help with my design and web building.

<Heading 
    tag="h1"
    name="styling"
>Styling</Heading>

For this project, I tried to utilize [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style my HTML. 
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a CSS framework that helps with 
styling your HTML without writing CSS. Instead, you would write pre-built classes straight into your 
HTML classes. 

For example, to enlarge and bold a text:

<DisplayCode>
    <h1 className="font-bold text-4xl">Sample Text</h1>
</DisplayCode>

<br/>

In plain CSS you would write: 

<CodeFrame>
    ```HTML
    <h1 class="big-bold-text">Sample Text</h1>
    ```
    ```CSS
    .big-bold-text {
        font-weight: bold;
        font-size: 32px;
    }
    ```
</CodeFrame>

<br/>

However, with Tailwind CSS, you would write straight into your HTML (or JS if you are 
using a framework like this project):

<CodeFrame>
    ```HTML
    <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl">
        Sample Text
    </h1>
    ```
</CodeFrame>

<br/>

You can read more about Tailwind CSS in their [official website](https://tailwindcss.com/).

<br/>

<Heading 
    tag="h1"
    name="markdown"
>Markdown</Heading>

I use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to apply markdown into my blog posts. 
It helps bringing the markdown to the next level by implementing dynamic interactivity, 
embed components into your content rather than just simple markdown.

<BlockQuote author="MDX">
    MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, 
    and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. ðŸš€
</BlockQuote>

To read more, follow this link to the [MDX official page]((https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/)).

<br/>

<Heading 
    tag="h2"
    name="next-mdx-remote"
>Next-MDX-remote</Heading>

[Next-MDX-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) helps implementing MDX into NextJS app easier. 
It also supports frontmatter and highlighting, which allows me to utilize post's metadata and styling my markdown.

There are different ways to use MDX in your markdown files: 

- [@next/MDX](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx)
- [next-MDX-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced)

<br/>

While @next/MDX is the basic implementation of MDX to NextJS app, next-MDX-enhanced helps with layouts, frontmatter, and paths of the MDX files. 
Basically, it provides more utilities to enhances to developers experience. Generally, I prefer **next-MDX-remote** instead of next-MDX-enhanced because 
"it is **~50% faster, more flexible with content storage, does not induce memory issues at scale, and fits much better with the way that data is intended to flow through next.js**." - 
developers of next-MDX-enhanced and -remote libraries.

<br/>

For example, the some code blocks in this markdown are displayed through a NextJS component, which allows me to 
**reuse the code interactive layout and add personal styling** with Tailwind CSS:

<CodeFrame titles="MDX, CodeLayout.js">
    ````JS
    <CodeLayout>
        ```
        console.log("Hello, World!")
        ```
    </CodeLayout>
    ````
    ````JS
    export default function CodeLayout({children}) {
        return (
            <div className="tailwindStyles">
                {children}
            </div>
        )
    }
    ````
</CodeFrame>

This will result in: 

```JS
console.log("Hello, World!")
```


<br/>

When deciding between which options work best for your blog, I recommend to read their official documentation for **the benefits and limitations**.

<br/>

<Heading 
    tag="h2"
    name="frontmatter"
>Frontmatter</Heading>

Frontmatter is basically metadata of your posts. For example, the metadata of this post is the title and the updated date at the top. 
I use [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) library, which is widely used to parse frontmatter data in markdown files. 

<br/>

It converts a markdown file like this:
```
---
title: Hello
slug: home
---
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
```

To this: 
```
{
  content: '<h1>Hello world!</h1>',
  data: { 
    title: 'Hello', 
    slug: 'home' 
  }
}
```

<br/>

<Heading 
    tag="h2"
    name="syntax-highlighting"
>Syntax highlighting</Heading>

For code highlighting in the markdown file, I use [rehypeHighlight](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight). 
This is a plugin that works with MDX to allow highlighting syntax through adding classes to the codes when the HTML is rendered. 


<BlockQuote author="rehypeHighlight">
    This package is a <a href="https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified" target="_blank">unified</a> (<a href="https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype" target="_blank">rehype</a>)
    plugin to apply syntax highlighting to code with `highlight.js`. `highlight.js` is pretty fast, relatively small, 
    and a quite good syntax highlighter which has support for up to 190 different languages. This package bundles 35 <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/lowlight#syntaxes" target="_blank">common languages</a> 
    by default and you can register more.

<Heading 
    tag="h2"
    name="storing-markdowns"
>Storing Markdowns</Heading>

I have tried using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (a non-SQL database) to store markdowns. The idea is that I want a blog 
that is interactive to myself. Similar to [Medium](https://medium.com/) and any other shared blogging websites, I initally 
visualized my website to be able to write and update blog posts on the website. However, I realized that there are **many limitations** 
to the method and I don't want to constraint my creativity for the sake of writing blog online. 

<br/>

For example, if I were to store my markdowns in an online database as strings, it would not allow me to implement different 
components that help styling my website. A notable illustration here is my code frame:

<CodeFrame titles="hello.js">
    ```
    function sayHello() {
        console.log("Hello, World!")
    }
    
    sayHello()
    ```
</CodeFrame>

<br/>

Since I write, store, and update my markdowns (MDX) locally, it allows me to treat each post uniquely, just like how different 
code files. With this, I can implement an in-house code frame with **my individual styling and preference**. In the end, I think 
I chose to store my markdowns locally because I want to **maximize the capability of MDX** so I could add my own creativity into my code.

<br/>

<Heading 
    tag="h1"
    name="final-words"
>Final Words</Heading>

At the end of the day, your website is still yours and there are so many different ways that you could create, design, and 
add your personality and creativity into it. For this post, I just want to show you the way that I do it and please keep in 
mind that I'm no expert in web development. **This is just one of my coding projects**. I'm still finding ways to optimize 
the website while learning bit and pieces of web development and see where my coding hobby takes me.
